# DOSO AI Product Context

## Problem Statement

Ford dealerships face significant challenges in inventory management:

1. **Suboptimal Inventory Mix**: Dealerships often struggle to maintain the right mix of vehicles that align with local market demand, resulting in slow-turning inventory and missed sales opportunities.

2. **Capital Inefficiency**: Excess or poorly matched inventory ties up capital that could be better utilized elsewhere in the business.

3. **Allocation Challenges**: The factory allocation process doesn't always align with what a dealership needs most, requiring strategic planning to maximize allocation opportunities.

4. **Market Volatility**: Consumer preferences and market conditions change rapidly, making it difficult to predict which configurations will sell best in the future.

5. **Data Overload**: Dealerships have access to vast amounts of sales, market, and inventory data, but struggle to convert this into actionable insights.
