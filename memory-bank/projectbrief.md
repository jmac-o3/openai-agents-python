# DOSO AI Project Brief

## Project Overview

DOSO AI (Dealer Inventory Optimization System) is a comprehensive AI-powered system designed to help Ford dealerships optimize their inventory management process, analyze market trends, and make data-driven decisions about vehicle orders and allocations.

## Core Requirements

1. **Inventory Optimization**
   - Analyze current inventory levels and aging
   - Calculate optimal inventory mix based on sales velocity, market trends, and seasonal patterns
   - Provide recommendations for reducing aged inventory

2. **Market Analysis**
   - Track competitive positioning in local markets
   - Analyze market share trends across different vehicle configurations
   - Identify regional preferences and demand patterns

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - Compare current inventory to optimal inventory mix
   - Identify high-opportunity configurations that are under-represented
   - Highlight potential overstock situations

4. **Order Planning**
   - Generate order recommendations based on gaps and constraints
   - Track allocation and order status
   - Provide constraint-aware suggestions for factory orders

5. **Self-Learning System**
   - Continuously improve recommendations through feedback loops
   - Apply machine learning to optimize weighting parameters
   - Adapt to changing market conditions and dealer preferences

6. **Multiple Implementation Options**
   - Standard Implementation (PostgreSQL + Redis)
   - OpenAI Assistants Implementation (file-based approach)

## Target Users

- Dealership inventory managers
- Sales directors
- General managers
- Regional allocation managers

## Success Criteria

1. Reduced days-to-turn (DTT) for inventory
2. Increased gross profit per unit
3. Optimized inventory levels (neither over-stocked nor under-stocked)
4. Improved allocation utilization
5. Enhanced market share in key segments

## Deployment Options

The system should support multiple deployment models:
- Full production deployment with database
- Simplified demo deployment for testing and presentation
- OpenAI Assistants-based deployment with minimal infrastructure

## Technical Approach

The system will be built using modern web technologies, machine learning components, and data visualization tools, with a focus on:

1. Modular architecture for easy maintenance and extensibility
2. Interactive visualizations for better decision-making
3. API-driven design for integration with other systems
4. Both SQL and vector-based data storage options
5. Streamlit-based UI for rapid development and deployment
